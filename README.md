Do you remember the fabulous *"Great Piece of Turf"* by *Albrecht Dürer*? (I've included the image below if you can't recall it) It's a prominent piece of Study Painting *(this particular one is a nature study)*, which obviously artists created either to understand an object better before using it in paintings, or to improve their skill, or just to find inspiration. 
I believe programming is very much **like art:** it also has  a **technical** and **content** side, it's a tool that helps expressing one's **mind work** and **beliefs**, and a purpose of a program is to **affect people** in some way.
Like artists paint their *Turfs* I research different fields of IT with the goal of mastering the art of programming and I use this repository as a showcase for my works.

By the way in Art I value **innovations** and **pioneering**, and I believe that in programming best solutions are ones that are most innovative,  most avant-garde. Coming up with new solutions - that's what programming is about.
