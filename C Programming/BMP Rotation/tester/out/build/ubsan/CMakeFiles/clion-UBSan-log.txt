CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  cmake_minimum_required() should be called prior to this top-level project()
  call.  Please see the cmake-commands(7) manual for usage documentation of
  both commands.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No cmake_minimum_required command is present.  A line of code such as

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.26)

CMake Warning (dev):
  Policy CMP0058 is not set: Ninja requires custom command byproducts to be
  explicit.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0058" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  This project specifies custom command DEPENDS on files in the build tree
  that are not specified as the OUTPUT or BYPRODUCTS of any
  add_custom_command or add_custom_target:

   image-transformer

  For compatibility with versions of CMake that did not have the BYPRODUCTS
  option, CMake is generating phony rules for such files to convince 'ninja'
  to build.

  Project authors should add the missing BYPRODUCTS or OUTPUT options to the
  custom commands that produce these files.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
