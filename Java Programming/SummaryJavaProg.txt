# ITMO Software Engineering 1 semester - Lab 2
The idea: introduce students to 
OOP, working with jars and external libs
on a simple Pokemon autofighting game

# ITMO Software Engineering 1 semester - Lab 3-4
The idea: work with complex Java features, different
class types, exceptions, reflection API by creating
a sizable project.

My project is a ship autofighting game with high
ship destructability?
